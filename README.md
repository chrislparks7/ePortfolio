## Artifacts

### Software Design and Engineering
My artifact for software design/engineering is an Android app that was created in a previous semester class that is meant to be an event tracking app.   You can view the source code for the app [here](https://github.com/chrislparks7/ePortfolio/blob/master/Event%20Tracking%20App%20(Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering).zip). Users can input important events they wish to remember and then will see a list of events and get reminders on the day of the events.  I chose this app for my artifact as it is a good display of my ability to create Android apps and working through the app helped build that knowledge base as well.  In addition, since the app is made in Android Studio, I utilized Java and XML coding languages to build the program which will show my skill in these two languages to self-promote my knowledge.  I have improved the app by following good coding practices and commenting my work throughout all the different Java modules so any outside viewer would be able to follow along with the code.  I also improved the method with which data is pulled from the database to the main program module by utilizing cursor search methods to query data from a database.  This was a valuable process to learn and will help me utilize this skill in the future.
